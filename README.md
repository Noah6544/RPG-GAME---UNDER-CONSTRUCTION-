## BACKGROUND
- I started coding this in homeroom and any spare time in 8th grade. I made the most progress during a Christmas roadtrip to baltimore. I haven't touched this in about
6 months, and today is 7-30-2020. I'm trying to create a game in which I can learn how to make GUI's, learn more python, and have something to show off to my friends 
next year.
## FUTURE THOUGHTS
- The game is likely never to be finished but I want to AT LEAST get the basic GUI structure complete, with player movement included.
I doubt that I will ever make another game, because I had already decided that I'm not going to go down the game development path after trying Unity for about a week or
two.
- I just don't want to abandon this old project and might as well "finish" this project and learn a bit about how to make a gui. kill 2 bird with 1 stone yea?

## CURRENT SITUATION
- this project is going to be on my backburner for proabably forever and is never going to get completed because I'm more passionate about other projects. I also think it 
would be smarter for me to research GUI creation another way.
- I now realize ( 12/3/20) that making this a full fleshed out game is something that isn't ever going to happen, so I would at least like to finish the first introductory tutorial fight and call this complete. This is because if I complete the tutorial fight then I will feel good about learning what I needed to learn from this project. And if I get a lot of support to finish the game in the years to come (which I really dont want to do because its gonna be 2d and I dont wanna be a game developer) then I might in order to learn some other things.

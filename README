I started coding this in homeroom and any spare time in 8th grade. I made the most progress during a Christmas roadtrip to baltimore. I haven't touched this in about
6 months, and today is 7-30-2020. I'm trying to create a game in which I can learn how to make GUI's, learn more python, and have something to show off t omy friends 
next year.
The game is likely never to be finished but I want to AT LEAST get the basic GUI structure complete, with player movement included.
I doubt that I will ever make another game, because I had already decided that I'm not going to go down the game development path after trying Unity for about a week or
two.
I just don't want to abandon this old projectand might as well "finish" this project and learn a bit about how to make a gui. kill 2 bird with 1 stone yea?
